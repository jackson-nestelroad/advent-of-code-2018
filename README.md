# Advent of Code 2018
This repository features solutions to the 2018 **Advent of Code** event hosted on https://adventofcode.com/2018/about.

## About
For my first time participating in the annual Advent of Code event, I decided to implement solutions in JavaScript (using Babel transpiler). I also took this time to learn about *test-driven development* and writing tests for my program, as the example cases given for each problem were perfect for writing tests.

There are a few exceptions, however; some days were written using other languages.

**Day 10**: Written in R for ease in plotting and working with points.
